        C is a powerful and versatile language that has been widely used for<br/>
        decades, powering some of the most important applications and systems.<br/>
        On this website, you'll find information on the most common uses of C,<br/>
        such as system programming, embedded systems, game development, and more. <br/>
        Whether you're a seasoned programmer or just starting out, this website <br/>
        provides a comprehensive guide to the many ways C can be used to solve <br/>
        real-world problems. <a onclick="subcon1()" style="color: #f2f2f2; cursor: pointer;"><u>...more</u></a>

        History of C:

        The rich history of the C programming language. C is a programming language that <br/>
        has been around for more than four decades and has had a profound impact on the <br/>
        development of computer science and technology. From its origins as a language for <br/>
        system programming, C has evolved into a widely-used language for a variety of <br/>
        applications and platforms. On this website, you'll learn about the history of C, <br/>
        from its creation to its evolution and its role in shaping modern computing. You'll <br/>
        also discover the people, events, and innovations that have shaped the development <br/>
        of this important language.<a onclick="subcon2()" style="color:#f2f2f2; cursor: pointer;"><u>...more</u></a>

    <div class="subcontent3">
        Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly<br>
        or indirectly from the C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP,<br/>
        JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on the C language.<br/>
        C++ is nearly a superset of C language (Only a few programs may<br/>
         compile in C, but not in C++).<br>
         So,  if a person learns C programming first, it will help him<br/>
         to learn any modern programming language as well. As learning C help<br/>
        to understand a lot of the underlying architecture of the operating system.<br/>
         Like pointers, working with memory locations, etc.<a href= "chapter1/start.html" style="color: #f2f2f2;" target="_parent">..more</a><br>
