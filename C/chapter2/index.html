          Integer arithmetic is a fundamental aspect of programming, and it is crucial for software<br/>
          developers to have a good understanding of it. In C programming language, integer arithmetic <br/>
          involves performing mathematical operations on integers, which are whole numbers that can be <br>
          positive, negative, or zero. In this article, we will discuss the theory, concepts, and <br>
          applications of integer arithmetic in C programming language.

            <dd>
              <p>
                In C programming language, there are several operators that can be used to perform integer <br>
                arithmetic operations. These operators include the addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*),<br>       
                division (/), and modulo (%). The addition and subtraction operators are used to perform basic <br>
                arithmetic operations, while the multiplication and division operators are used to perform more <br>
                complex operations. The modulo operator is used to find the remainder of a division operation.
              </p>
              <p>
                One important concept in integer arithmetic is the concept of overflow. Overflow occurs when the <br/>
                result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the data <br>
                type. For example, if we add two integers that are close to the maximum value that can be represented <br>
                by an int data type, the result may exceed the maximum value, and overflow will occur. Overflow can <br>
                lead to unexpected results, and it is important to be aware of it when performing integer arithmetic operations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another important concept in integer arithmetic is the concept of type casting. Type casting is the <br/>
                process of converting one data type to another. For example, if we have two integers and we want to <br>
                divide them, we may need to cast them to a floating-point data type to get an accurate result.

                Integer arithmetic is used in many applications, including finance, physics, and computer graphics. <br>
                In finance, integer arithmetic is used to perform calculations such as interest rates and compound <br>
                interest. In physics, integer arithmetic is used to perform calculations such as force, acceleration, <br>
                and velocity. In computer graphics, integer arithmetic is used to perform calculations such as image <br>
                compression and color manipulation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Integer arithmetic is also used in many programming tasks, such as sorting algorithms and data structures. <br>
                For example, the quicksort algorithm uses integer arithmetic to sort a list of integers. The binary search <br>
                algorithm also uses integer arithmetic to search for a specific value in a sorted list.

                In C programming language, real arithmetic involves using floating-point data types to represent real numbers. <br>
                The most commonly used floating-point data types are float and double. The float data type is a 32-bit floating-point <br>
                number, while the double data type is a 64-bit floating-point number. Real arithmetic operations in C programming <br>
                language include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and exponentiation (pow() function).
              </p>
              <p>
                One important concept in real arithmetic is the concept of rounding errors. Rounding errors occur because floating-point <br>
                numbers can only represent a finite number of digits. As a result, some numbers cannot be represented exactly, and rounding <br>
                errors can occur when performing arithmetic operations. Rounding errors can accumulate over multiple operations, leading to <br>
                inaccuracies in the final result. It is important to be aware of rounding errors when performing real arithmetic operations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another important concept in real arithmetic is the concept of precision. Precision refers to the number of digits that <br>
                can be represented by a floating-point number. The precision of a floating-point number depends on the data type used to <br>
                represent it. The float data type has a precision of approximately 7 digits, while the double data type has a precision of <br>
                approximately 15 digits.

                is used to perform calculations such as present value, future value, and compound interest. In physics, real arithmetic is <br>
                used to perform calculations such as distance, velocity, and acceleration. In computer graphics, real arithmetic is used to <br>
                perform calculations such as 3D transformations and lighting calculations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Real arithmetic is also used in many programming tasks, such as numerical analysis and simulation. For example, the Runge-Kutta <br>
                method for solving differential equations uses real arithmetic to approximate the solution at each step. The Monte Carlo method <br>
                for simulating complex systems also uses real arithmetic to generate random numbers.
