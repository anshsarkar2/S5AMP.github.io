                <h3>
                    Microsoft Said to Threaten to Restrict Rival Search Engines' Data Access Over AI Chat Products
                </h3>
                <p><p>Microsoft's rivals have quickly moved to roll out their own AI chatbots to compete with the company's revamped Bing service.</p><p>Microsoft Corp. has threatened to cut off access to its internet-search data, which it licenses to rival search engines if they don't stop using it as the basis for their own artificial intelligence chat products, according to people familiar with the dispute.</p><p>The software maker licenses the data in its Bing search index — a map of the internet that can be quickly scanned in real-time — to other companies that offer web searches, such as Apollo Global Management Inc.'s Yahoo and DuckDuckGo. In February, Microsoft integrated a cousin of ChatGPT, OpenAI's AI-powered chat technology, into Bing.</p><p>Rivals quickly moved to roll out their own AI chatbots as the hype built around the buzzy technology. This week, Alphabet Inc.'s Google publicly released Bard, its conversational AI product. DuckDuckGo, a search engine that emphasizes privacy, introduced DuckAssist, a feature that uses artificial intelligence to summarize answers to search queries. You.com and Neeva Inc. — two newer search engines that debuted in 2021 — have also debuted AI-fueled search services, YouChat and NeevaAI.</p><p>These search chatbots aim to combine the conversational skills of ChatGPT with the information provided by a conventional search engine. DuckDuckGo, You.com, and Neeva's regular search engines all use Bing to provide some of their information because indexing the entire web is costly — it requires servers to store data and a constant crawl of the internet to incorporate updates. It would be similarly complex and pricey to get together that data for a search chatbot.</p><p>Microsoft has told at least two customers that using its Bing search index to feed their AI chat tools violates the terms of their contract, according to the people, who spoke anonymously because they were discussing a confidential dispute. The Redmond, Washington-based technology company said it may terminate the licenses providing access to its search index, the people said.</p><p>“We've been in touch with partners who are out of compliance as we continue to consistently enforce our terms across the board,” Microsoft said in a statement. “We'll continue to work with them directly and provide any information needed to find a path forward.”</p><p>If they were cut off from Microsoft's index, smaller search engines would have a hard time finding an alternative. Microsoft and Google are the only two companies that index the entire web, and Google's limitations on the use of its index have led nearly all other search engines to use Bing. </p></p>

                <h3>
                    Google Releases AI Chatbot Bard to Public, Seeks User Feedback to Catch Up to Microsoft, ChatGPT
                </h3>
                <p><p>Alphabet Inc's Google on Tuesday began the public release of its chatbot Bard, seeking users and feedback to gain ground on Microsoft Corp in a fast-moving race on artificial intelligence technology.</p><p>Starting in the U.S. and the U.K., consumers can join a waitlist for English-language access to Bard, a program previously open to approved testers only. Google describes Bard as an experiment allowing collaboration with generative AI, technology that relies on past data to create rather than identify content.</p><p>The release last year of ChatGPT, a chatbot from the Microsoft-backed startup OpenAI, has caused a sprint in the technology sector to put AI into more users' hands. The hope is to reshape how people work and win business in the process.</p><p>Just last week, Google and Microsoft made a flurry of announcements on AI, two days apart. The companies are putting draft-writing technology into their word processors and other collaboration software, as well as marketing-related tools for web developers to build their own AI-based applications.</p><p>Asked whether competitive dynamics were behind Bard's rollout, Jack Krawczyk, a senior product director, said Google was focused on users. Internal and external testers have turned to Bard for "boosting their productivity, accelerating their ideas, really fueling their curiosity," he said.</p><p>In a demonstration of the site bard.google.com to Reuters, Krawczyk showed how the program produces blocks of text in an instant, different from how ChatGPT types out answers word by word.</p><p>Bard also included a feature showing three different versions or "drafts" of any given answer among which users could toggle, and it displayed a button stating "Google it," should a user desire web results for a query.</p><p>Accuracy, however, is still a concern. "Bard will not always get it right," a Google pop-up notice warned during the demo. Last month, a promotional video for Bard showed the program answering a question incorrectly, helping shave $100 billion off Alphabet's market value.</p><p>Google highlighted a couple mistakes during this week's demo to Reuters, for instance saying Bard wrongly claimed ferns required bright, indirect light in response to one query.</p><p>Bard also produced nine paragraphs of text when asked for four in another question. After that answer, Krawczyk clicked a thumbs-down feedback button in response.</p><p>"We know the limitations of the technology, and so we want to be very deliberate at the pace at which we roll this out," he said.</p></p>

The statement also included a requirement for Kesharwani to collect all the data of S5AMP and make a file, which must be submitted to Sarkar within the next two weeks.</p><p>"This is a mandatory requirement and failure to comply may result in further disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment," the statement said. "We value the contributions Kesharwani has made to the company in the past and we hope that this warning will be taken in a positive light, and that appropriate action will be taken to address the concerns raised."</p><p>The warning has raised questions about the future of Kesharwani's role in S5AMP. However, the company has stated that it will provide support and resources to assist Kesharwani in improving his performance.</p><p>S5AMP is a leading tech company that specializes in database management systems, and this warning has sparked discussions about the importance of effective management in tech companies. The incident serves as a reminder that even in the tech industry, good management skills are crucial to the success of a business.</p><p>It remains to be seen how Kesharwani will respond to the warning and whether he will be able to meet the expectations set out for his role. However, the incident underscores the importance of performance management in the tech industry, and serves as a reminder that companies must take steps to ensure that their employees are meeting the required standards.</p><p>
